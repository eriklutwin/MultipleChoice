Multiple Choice Quiz

It is a Python 3 console application that lets you quiz yourself or others on whatever you like.

To make your own quiz, just modify the QandA.txt file
The format is:
prompt
correct_answer
other_choice1
other_choice2

Each goes on its own line, but no additional lines are inserted between different questions

For example:

What is the atomic weight of unenriched uranium?
235
238
250
Which is not a fruit?
broccoli
tomato
apple

------------------
The file has two classes: "Question" to get the data from the quiz, and "Choice" to randomize the choices while keeping track of the correct answer.
